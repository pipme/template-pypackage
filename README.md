# A simple template for python packages.

The primary aim for this template is for prototyping python projects (usually machine learning related) that follow some good conventions. Conda environment is supported for development via `environment.yml`.

To create a new python project using this template, run:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter  # Install cookiecutter first, there are other ways, e.g. brew install
cookiecutter https://github.com/pipme/template-pypackage.git  # ~10s for setup
```
